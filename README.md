# Piano-Note-Recognition
Piano YouTube videos turned into Sheet Music

This project was completed in collaboration with two other colleagues at UBC, Harman Sihota (Github: HarmanSihota) and Juliana Choi (Github: juliana-choi). The inspiration for the project was to facilitate piano players to learn how to play new compositions that are performed by other artists on Youtube.

The code is divided in two major components. The Machine Learning (ML) and the Non-ML component. Every milestone above contain a report explaining the team thoughts, and each member's contributions. Also, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYp1YV_NHOM">Youtube Video</a> will explain the code and how to use it as we have not created a public HTTP link to make use of the website yet.

It was inspiring to work in collaboration with these colleagues as I have learned a lot from them and by making online researches and reaching out to our UBC professors. It helped me improving my Machine Learning and my Web Development skills.
